# ice_grids
Creating ice grids for input into GIA models

The initial source code was originally used to create grids for SELEN, which uses a Tegmark (hexagonal) grid. The Tegmark grid code was released into the public domain. I originally put this code in a fork of the SELEN repository (https://github.com/evangowan/selen/tree/evan_mod/pixel), but really it should have been placed separately and documented.
